I received the B.Eng. in Telecommunication Engineering from Xiangtan University, China, in 2015, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Data Communications and in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Sheffield, UK, in 2017 and 2022, respectively. In 2022, I joined the School of Internet of Things (IoT) of Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU), China, as an Assistant Professor.  

My research interests are in wireless communication systems, with special emphasis on dynamic and intelligent spectrum sharing and accessing, vehicular-to-everything (V2X) communications, cloud/mobile-edge/fog/device-to-device assisted radio access networks, and the development of system modelling and optimisation algorithms for wireless Internet of Things, aiming to enhance overall system performance and efficiency. 

I am/have been the principal investigator (PI) or co-investigator (CoI) of research projects competitively funded in wireless communications-related topics. I have also been involved in European-funded projects as a PhD researcher during my PhD studies. I have published over 20 papers in refereed journals (five under review) and recognised conferences. 

I have been co-chair of several IEEE International Workshops on Wireless Communications-Related Topics (2024 ICCCN, 2024 VTC-Fall, etc.). I have also been TPC for several IEEE conferences (WCNC, VTC, etc.) as well as a reviewer for Vehicular Communications Journals.
